API Queries and Mutations
Make an Endpoint Request
Jobber's API is GraphQL based. This means all API requests are sent via POST to the following URL:

https://api.getjobber.com/api/graphql

As of Apr. 2, 2024, Jobber API's is no longer accepting any endpoint requests with the application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data content types. All GraphQL requests must be made with the application/json content type. If using the Guzzle HTTP client library, you can follow this guide for instructions on switching to the application/json content type.

To make a successful request you must include a header with the Authorization key, and a value consisting of the access token you received via the OAuth 2.0 flow prepended with the word 'bearer'. See the example curl request below.

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" "https://api.getjobber.com/api/graphql"
Assuming the access token is valid, the API will process the request according to its API specifications. If the access token is invalid, the API will return a 401 "invalid_request" error.

For more on how to use GraphQL, see the Official guides.

API Queries
In order to request data from the API you will need to include a GraphQL query in the payload of your API request.

Query Example:

query SampleQuery {
  clients {
    nodes {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      billingAddress {
        city
      }
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
API Mutations
Any time you would like your app to modify any data in Jobber, a GraphQL mutation will be required.

Mutation Example:

mutation SampleMutation {
  clientCreate(
    input: {
      firstName: "Jane"
      lastName: "Doe"
      companyName: "Jane's Automotive"
      emails: [
        { description: MAIN, primary: true, address: "jane.doe@example.com" }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    client {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
    userErrors {
      message
      path
    }
  }
}
ℹ️ When using the clientCreate mutation above, the name of your app will automatically be captured in the Lead source field that is built into Jobber. The lead source field for an app-created client cannot be edited by Jobber users. This functionality applies to all clients created after Sept. 16, 2024. The lead source field was not tracked automatically on clients created before Sept. 16, 2024, but this data may be backfilled in the future.
